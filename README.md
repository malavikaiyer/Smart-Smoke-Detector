# Smart-Smoke-Detector
Smoke detectors generally alert those who are present in the house. This project aims at alerting you when you are away from home. The Smart Smoke Detector issues a notification as soon as the smoke alarm starts beeping. The user will be notified using text messages and email. The device used for controlling the setup is Particle Photon. There are three sensors- the carbon monoxide sensor, temperature sensor and the motion detection sensor. The three sensors work together in order monitor the status of the smoke detector. Once a fire is detected, the data is published to Particle cloud. The data is used to trigger a text message and email notifications using IFTTT. The data from Particle Cloud is then fetched by AWS instance and a change is the data is reflected on the website. The user is notified through messages and emails and can also check the status on the website after logging in.
